Skyrim Online
===================================

This is an old project of SkyrimOnline with some modifications on it. I created it because I need to fork the original project from Yamashi branch and I can't fork the same project twice.

The project is [here](https://github.com/yamashi/SkyrimOnline).

This branch is from Nihlus project.
